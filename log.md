### Day 1: July 18, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've started my fisrt small project 'KidCal'. I created the directories, made small design additions and pushed to github.

**Thoughts** This should be a simple challenge for me. The most challenging thing will probably be placing the numbers exactly where I want them.. Once that's out of the way I think I'll be pretty solid.
