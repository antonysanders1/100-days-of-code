### Day 1: July 18, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've started my fisrt small project 'KidCal'. I created the directories, made small design additions and pushed to github.

**Thoughts** This should be a simple challenge for me. The most challenging thing will probably be placing the numbers exactly where I want them.. Once that's out of the way I think I'll be pretty solid.

### Day 1: July 20, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I properly aligned the history and result containers for later use... I created the buttons for the calculator and styled them in css.

**Thoughts** I'm thinking that I want to add deeper functionality with this kid calculator (i.e. interactive sound, ability to select gender and age prior to use, different modes like animals shapes and colors...). Could be a fun extention to this simple app!
