### Day 1: July 18, 2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've started my fisrt small project 'KidCal'. I created the directories, made small design additions and pushed to github.

**Thoughts** This should be a simple challenge for me. The most challenging thing will probably be placing the numbers exactly where I want them.. Once that's out of the way I think I'll be pretty solid.

### Day 2: July 20, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I properly aligned the history and result containers for later use... I created the buttons for the calculator and styled them in css.

**Thoughts** I'm thinking that I want to add deeper functionality with this kid calculator (i.e. interactive sound, ability to select gender and age prior to use, different modes like animals shapes and colors...). Could be a fun extention to this simple app!

### Day 3: July 23, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the css for my calculator and added logic to the js file. The calculator can do simple arithmatic!  
SIDE NOTE: I worked on my private project yesterday using ruby on rails... can't really get into the details yet cause its proprietary -- but hopefully soon!

**Thoughts** I'm having issues displaying my html files without going through a ton of loops... Hopefully I can solve this small issue in a manner that is sound.

### Day 4: Aug 5, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Using Ruby on Rails: I created a 'Header partial' for the static pages of my site, then implemented working links to those pages. I replaced the div containers with semantic containers for best practices.

**Thoughts** I did some extra HTML learning today it really benifited me greatly during this portion of my project.

I can't share the repo to this project as it is private.. but [HERE](https://learn.co/lessons/html5-semantic-containers-code-along) is a link to the resource about semantic containers I followed.

### Day 5: Aug 6, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Using Ruby on Rails: I updated the database for Oauth authentication. I was able to create the authentication routes for my Customer(users) successfully. Updates were made to the 'Header partial' to display changes based on authentication.

**Thoughts** Feeling really proud of how much I actually got accomplished today.. Much more work ahead...

I can't share the repo yet because this project is private and proprietary..

### Day 6: Aug 12, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Using HTML, CSS & Js: I created a really cool button animation that pulsates until clicked. When clicked it quickly shrinks and expands out!

**Thoughts** Coding in these three laguages is getting easier. I learned a bit more about css animations. Used my knowledge to invoke the animation with a js event listener.
